Hi, I’m @jacareh, but everybody calls me Fabio.
I’m currently learning python3 on a robotic project. I am interested also in projects with raspberry, arduino, esp32 or littler. 
My abilities came from day life hacking, Undergratuate in Engineering, Youtube Enhanced Skill and sometimes by unknown forces.
I am Photonic Specialist, my interests in the Physics of light begun because of LEDs and LASERs, but also with uncommon light sources and controllers fot them.
Nowadays the UV Disinfection became my focus because of the Pandemic and the importance of UV-C to disinfect the air of public ambients, offices and others facilities.
My work is been bringing this tech to real life.
You can reach me by email (jacareh at gmail)
