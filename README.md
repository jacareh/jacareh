Hei, thank you for start reading my bio! My name is Fabio, but most people call me Jacareh.

I do things that don't exist yet, because I'm a researcher and developer. Some of them may seem easy, but I like the challenges of the more difficult ones that involve mechanics, hydraulics, batteries, electronics and software. (If it's rewarding enough ($$) I can even make it fly).

My skills came from the necessary hacking of everyday life, a degree in Computer Engineering and a few years working at the Photonics Department at Unicamp (University of Campinas).

I've already made a Time Machine embedded in an original 1981 Delorean that is considered the best in my country (Brazil).

In this case I used a lot of special color LEDs to make the effects as realistic as possible (Back to the Future 1 movie), controlled by special electronics and two Arduino Megas.

I have worked on projects with ESP32 and Raspberry Pi as well. Some projects I have made have no computer inside, just separated electronic components as sensors, solenoids transistors, LEDs, motors and/or batteries.

I'm an expert in LEDs (light emitting diodes), but I also love old light sources and controllers for them.

You can contact me by email (jacareh at gmail) or by my whatsapp +55 19 99615 1889.

And thank you for finish reading my bio. Have a nice day!
