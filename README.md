Hi, Iâ€™m Fabio, but almost everybody calls me Jacareh.
I make things that do not already exist, specially the dificult ones which involves hardwares and softwares. 
My abilities came from day life hacking, Undergratuate in Computing Engineering and sometimes by unknown forces.
I have already made a Time Machine on a original Delorean which is considered the best one in my country (Brasil)
I am a LED(light diode emitter) specialist, but also love old light sources and controllers for them.
You can reach me by email (jacareh at gmail)
