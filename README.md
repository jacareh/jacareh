Hi, I’m @jacareh
I’m currently learning python on a robotic project. I am interested also in a photonic or biophotonic project with raspberry, arduino or esp32. 
I am Photonic Specialist, my interests in the Physics of light begin with LEDs and later LASERs. Nowadays the UV Disinfection became my focus because of the Pandemic.
You can reach me by email (jacareh at gmail)
