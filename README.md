Hi, Iâ€™m @jacareh
Iâ€™m interested in robotics
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a robotic project with raspberry, arduino and esp32. 
I am Photonic Specialist, my interests in the Physics of light begin with LEDs and later LASERs. Nowadays the UV Disinfection became my focus because of the Pandemic.
